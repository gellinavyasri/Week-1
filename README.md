# Week-1
Forecasting EV adoption in Washington State using vehicle registration data (2017â€“2024). This project analyzes trends in BEVs, PHEVs, and total vehicle counts to build a regression model that predicts future EV demand, aiding planners in optimizing charging infrastructure.
Objectives Completed
 -Understood the problem statement: Forecast future electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends.
 -Explored the given dataset (monthly EV registration data per U.S. county).
 -Performed basic data cleaning and preprocessing.

 # Week-2
  -Feature engineering
  -Model Selection
  -Model Evaluation
  -Forecasting
  -Final Model Testing and Saving the Model

 # Week-3: App Development
Developed app.py using Streamlit for interactive visualization
Integrated trained model into a web-based UI
Enabled users to select counties and view EV forecast trends
Focused on usability, charts, and regional prediction interactivity
