## Week 1: Problem Understanding & Data Preparation
Forecasting EV adoption in Washington State using vehicle registration data (2017–2024).  
This week focused on analyzing BEV, PHEV, and total vehicle trends to prepare for model development.

**Objectives Completed:**
- Understood the problem: Forecast future EV adoption trends  
- Explored the dataset (monthly EV registrations by U.S. county)  
- Performed basic data cleaning and preprocessing  

---

## Week 2: Model Development & Forecasting
Focused on building and evaluating a regression model for accurate EV demand prediction.

**Tasks Completed:**
- Feature engineering  
- Model selection (Random Forest Regressor)  
- Model evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²)  
- Forecasting EV adoption  
- Final testing and model saving  

---

## Week 3: App Development
Created an interactive visualization app to present forecasting insights.

**Tasks Completed:**
- Developed `app.py` using **Streamlit**  
- Integrated the trained model into a user-friendly web UI  
- Enabled county selection and dynamic EV trend forecasts  
- Focused on usability, data charts, and interactivity
